      <img src="assets/images/Gabe_in_a_suit.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Gabriel Vermund. I am an energetic, passionate, reliable person looking for a career in the entertainment business. I have experience working many minimum-wage jobs including in places like Disney World and Regal Entertainment. I am currently pursuing a certificate in web-development from the University of Central Florida through its part-time Bootcamp.</p>

      <p>A career in tech interests me in large part because of the growing nature of it. Everything is being run on computers, and no matter how advanced the technology gets, somebody is going to have to be able to fix problems when they go wrong. That is where I hope to come in. My portfolio is always a work in progress, and I hope to continue to progress in my studies and my career.</p>
