            <p>My name is Gabriel Vermund. I am a current Disney World Cast
                Member. I have been with the company for almost a year doing many 
                different important tasks to make magic for the guests. My first role
                was with All Star Movies, a value resort that is part of The Animal
                Kingdom resort area. It is very near Blizzard Beach and Hollywood 
                Studios. I was a Quick Service Food and Beverage Cast Member. I 
                liked being a cast member so much I decided that I wanted to stay in 
                Orlando and continue with the company. I know am a photographer for 
                Disney Photo Imaging or "DPI." Officially, I am a photopass photographer,
                but I like to think of my job title as a "memory maker." It is a nice job,
                especially when I have greatful guests with kids who want to capture 
                special memories with their children.

            <p>I intend to continue work with the Disney company. I am in UCF's part time
                Coding Bootcamp because I want to add to my skillset for Disney, and I 
                want to continue working for the company. I want my career at Disney to 
                be long, and I do not feel like I can do photopass forever.
